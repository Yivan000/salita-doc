# Platform support for Salita

Salita supports the following platforms.
* Android 4.4 (API 19) & above
* Windows 7 & above (64-bit)
* Linux (64-bit)*
* Web browser

Salita on these platforms are technically supported, however, I have not compiled a functional application for them to use. This is because I do not own nor have the money to own these devices to develop Salita on, let alone publish in their app stores. They, however, will still be included in the documentations.
* iOS 11 & above
* macOS El Capitan (10.11) & above

**Salita on Linux is technically supported, however, it would take me a long time for me to compile a functioning application for them since I don't have extensive knowledge on Linux in general yet.*


## Feature differences per platform

Due to the different capabilities and limitations for each platform, some features are not available for certain platforms.
